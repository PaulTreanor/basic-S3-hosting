# Basic S3 hosting with the Serverless Framework 

Made for future reference. No domains, literally just a bucket with distribution files in it. Useful for letting peopel get their hands on a quick prototype without any overhead. 

# How to use 
1. Put website files in /static
2. Edit details in serverless.yml
3. Remember that the bucket name (custom siteName) must be unique
